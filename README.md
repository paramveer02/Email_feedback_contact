# Email_feedback_contact
This is a simple Email feedback form.
In the Settings, i have  the Email host, email host user, email backend , email port and rest my login credentials
The user can enter their email, Subject and a message which will then be delivered to the Host Email.
The interface has been kept very basic and simple as the main focus of this app is to practise email feedbck forms which can be extended to any website
Practising and understanding this code will help developers at beginner level to understand the working of email based feedback which they can later apply to their Feedback or contact form of any other website
